1. Hositing ?

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables, function declarations and classes are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation.

2. Closure ?
A closure is the combination of a function bundled(enclosed) together with its lexical environment within which that function was declared.
 i.e, It is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing function’s variables,
 functions and other data even after the outer function has finished its execution. The closure has three scope chains.

Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets
Outer function's variables
Global variables

3. Currying ?

Currying is the process of taking a function with multiple arguments and turning it into a sequence of functions each with only a single argument. 
Currying is named after a mathematician Haskell Curry. By applying currying, an n-ary function turns into a unary function.

const multiArgFunction = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
console.log(multiArgFunction(1, 2, 3)); // 6

const curryUnaryFunction = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;
curryUnaryFunction(1); // returns a function: b => c =>  1 + b + c
curryUnaryFunction(1)(2); // returns a function: c => 3 + c
curryUnaryFunction(1)(2)(3); // returns the number 6

4.differene between const and obj.freeze?
const and Object.freeze() are not the same, const prevents reassignment and Object.freeze() prevents mutability

const is there for declaring a variable which has to assinged right away and can't be reassigned. 
variables declared by const are block scoped and not function scoped like variables declared with var
Object.freeze() is a method which accepts an object and returns the same object. Now the object cannot have any of its properties removed or any new properties added.

5.Promises ?

A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future with either a resolved value or a reason that it’s not resolved(for example, network error).
It will be in one of the 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending.

const promise = new Promise(
  (resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("I'm a Promise!");
    }, 5000);
  },
  (reject) => {}
);

promise.then((value) => console.log(value));

Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations.
They provide an alternative approach for callbacks by reducing the callback hell and writing the cleaner code.



A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. 
This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an action. Let's take a simple example of how to use callback function
 
function callbackFunction(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}

function outerFunction(callback) {
  let name = prompt("Please enter your name.");
  callback(name);
}

outerFunction(callbackFunction); 

6.difference between subject v/s observable and behaviour subject


Observables are declarative which provide support for passing messages between publishers and subscribers in your application.
They are mainly used for event handling, asynchronous programming, and handling multiple values.
In this case, you define a function for publishing values, but it is not executed until a consumer subscribes to it.
The subscribed consumer then receives notifications until the function completes, or until they unsubscribe.
 
 
 
An RxJS Subject is a special type of Observable that allows values to be multicasted to many Observers.
While plain Observables are unicast (each subscribed Observer owns an independent execution of the Observable), Subjects are multicast.

A Subject is like an Observable, but can multicast to many Observers.
Subjects are like EventEmitters: they maintain a registry of many listeners.
subject emit new value through next() method and listners get the notification.
it won't store pervious value.
 

 import { Subject } from 'rxjs';

   const subject = new Subject<number>();

   subject.subscribe({
     next: (v) => console.log(`observerA: ${v}`)
   });
   subject.subscribe({
     next: (v) => console.log(`observerB: ${v}`)
   });

   subject.next(1);
   subject.next(2);
   
Behavioural subject supports generic value and default value. It is a special type of subject  the subscriber gets last init or published value.(Only one)

Replay Subject last init or published (more than one ) values.
 i.e we need to pass the number of values to be stored . It uses buffer size to keep the no% item to store. 


observable
1)we need a seperate observer interface to feed an observal source/
observables can't be consumers
2)they are cold they can emit the data only when there is subscriber
3)unicast by default

 

subject
1)implements both observable and observer interface/subject can be both consumer and provider
2)subject is hot it emits the data even if there is no subscriber
3)subjects are multicasting

 

Observable: Subscribe to it to get the values
Subject: Same but you also have control of the values that you want to emit into it (can subscribe to it but also emit)
ReplaySubject: Same as subject but will keep track of the N latest emitted values and every time you subscribe to it, it'll emit those N values
BehaviorSubject: Subject where you have to set a default value, if you subscribe to it before anything has been emitted you'll get the default value

8.debounce and throttling ?

Debouncing is a programming pattern that allows delaying execution of some piece of code until a specified time to avoid unnecessary CPU cycles and API calls.
This in turn enhance the web page performance. The debounce function make sure that your code is only triggered once per user input.
The common usecases are Search box suggestions, text-field auto-saves, and eliminating double-button clicks.
 
Throttling is a technique used to limit the execution of an event handler function in a given period of time,
even when this event triggers continuously due to user actions.
The common use cases are browser resizing, window scrolling, mouse movements etc.
 
9.hot and cold observable ?
 
Cold observables have their data produced inside the observable.

Hot observables have their data produced outside the observable.

Cold Observables only emit data once subscribed to;

Hot Observables emit values even before the subscription is made. Used when sharing data among many subscribers.

10.why typscript used in javascript
It is a superset of JavaScript that adds strong type checking and is compiled into plain JavaScript code.
Being a superset means that TypeScript has all the features of JavaScript as well as some additional features.
TypeScript comes with features such as better development-time tooling, static code analysis, compile-time type checking, and code-level documentation.

15.what are the ways we can maintain state in javascript?

a state simply refers to the status of a system or an application at a specific moment.
For instance, if you are logged in a website, the website is in an "authenticated" state. If you log out, the website is in an "unauthenticated" state.

In JavaScript, you can maintain state using various methods, depending on the complexity and scope of your application:
1. Local Component State (For UI Libraries/Frameworks):
Angular: @Component decorator's state property or the @ngrx/store library for centralized state management.

2. Global State Management Libraries:
Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

3. Simple Variables and Objects:
For smaller applications, you can use plain JavaScript variables or objects to store state.

4. Local Storage and Session Storage:
For persisting state across sessions, you can use the browser's local storage or session storage.

Choosing the Right Method:
Local state: If the state is only needed within a single component, use local state.
Global state: If the state needs to be shared between multiple components, consider a global state management library .
Persistence: If you need to persist state across sessions, use local storage or session storage.

16.what is event flow in javascript ?
Event flow is the order in which event is received on the web page.
When you click an element that is nested in various other elements, before your click actually reaches its destination, or target element,
it must trigger the click event for each of its parent elements first, starting at the top with the global window object.

There are two ways of event flow

Top to Bottom(Event Capturing)
Bottom to Top (Event Bubbling)


Event bubbling is a type of event propagation where the event first triggers on the innermost target element,
and then successively triggers on the ancestors (parents) of the target element 
in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the outermost DOM element(i.e, global window object).


Event capturing is a type of event propagation where the event is first captured by the outermost element, 
and then successively triggers on the descendants (children) of the target element
in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the innermost target DOM element.

You need to pass true value for addEventListener method to trigger event handlers in event capturing phase.

<div>
  <button class="child">Hello</button>
</div>

<script>
  const parent = document.querySelector("div");
  const child = document.querySelector(".child");

  parent.addEventListener("click",
    function () {
      console.log("Parent");
    },
    true
  );

  child.addEventListener("click", function () {
    console.log("Child");
  });
</script>
// Parent
// Child

25. what is the use of constructor in angular ?
 
 1. Dependency Injection:
Constructors are the primary mechanism for injecting dependencies into Angular components, services, and directives.
By specifying the dependencies as constructor parameters,
Angular's dependency injection system automatically provides the required instances when the class is instantiated.

2. Simple Initialization:
You can use constructors to initialize class properties with simple values or perform basic setup tasks that don't depend on external dependencies.

28.how to make service as singleton in angular ?

The preferred way to create a singleton service is to set providedIn to root on the service's @Injectable() decorator.
This tells Angular to provide the service in the application root. 

29.If we use script tag in html template then wat will happen ?

Angular recognizes the value as unsafe and automatically sanitizes it, which removes the script tag but keeps safe content such as the text content of the script tag.

31.how to append the token to each http request? 

add the inteseptor which accepets the request and respose with the header

32.can we have multiple interceptor? 

yes on it own scope like for setting the header and for error handling

33.what type of compiler? 

The Angular compiler is used to convert the application code into JavaScript code.
It reads the template markup, combines it with the corresponding component class code, and emits component factories which creates JavaScript representation of the component
along with elements of @Component metadata.

37.type of injector hiearchy ?

ModuleInjector hierarchy: It configure on a module level using an @NgModule() or @Injectable() annotation.

ElementInjector hierarchy: It created implicitly at each DOM element. Also it is empty by default unless you configure it in the providers property on @Directive() or @Component().

38.in which all scenerio change detection works?

39.reverse a string without built in function? let output="";
for(let i=a.length-1;i>=0;i--){
    output+=a[i]
}
with builtin
a.split("").reverse().join("")

40.find v/s filter v/s map

map returns an array with the same length,

filter as the name implies, it returns an array with less items than the original array

reduce returns a single value (or object)

find returns the first items in an array that satisfies a condition

41.what is content projection ?

Content projection is a pattern in which you insert, or project, the content you want to use inside another component.

42.what is z-index in css?
 overlapping
 
The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.

An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.

43.what is opacity? tranparency

Any <number> strictly between 0 and 1 . default value is 1

44.difference between flex and grid?

Flexbox Layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column.

Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time

45.what is pseduo code/ pseduo class?

it is a keyword added to the selector that specify the special state of the selected element. host .ngdeep, hover in css.

46.let and var difference?

https://github.com/sudheerj/javascript-interview-questions?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-the-difference-between-let-and-var

47.different operators in javascript ?

i.e spead opeartor and rest operatore

Rest parameter is an improved way to handle function parameters which allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
function f(a, b, ...theArgs) {
  // ...
}

Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into single arguments/elements.

function calculateSum(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(calculateSum(...numbers)); // 6

48.shallow copy and deep copy ?
var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails; //Shallow copying!
empDetailsShallowCopy.name = "Johnson";
The above statement will also change the name of empDetails, since we have a shallow copy. That means we're losing the original data as well.

var empDetailsDeepCopy = {
  name: empDetails.name,
  age: empDetails.age,
  expertise: empDetails.expertise,
};

Now if you change empDetailsDeepCopy.name, it will only affect empDetailsDeepCopy & not empDetails

A deep copy means that all of the values of the new variable are copied and disconnected from the original variable.
A shallow copy means that certain (sub-)values are still connected to the original variable.

49.object methods in javacscript ?

// Copies properties from a source object to a target object
Object.assign(target, source)

// Creates an object from an existing object
Object.create(object)

// Returns an array of the key/value pairs of an object
Object.entries(object)

// Creates an object from a list of keys/values
Object.fromEntries()

// Returns an array of the keys of an object
Object.keys(object)

// Returns an array of the property values of an object
Object.values(object)

50.arrow function limitation ?

No own "this" context:
Unlike traditional functions, arrow functions do not create their own "this" context.
it will refer this to parent context or surrounding context.

const person = {

  name: "John",

  greet: () => {

    console.log(this.name); // This will print "undefined" because the arrow function inherits the "this" from the global scope

  }

};



person.greet(); // Outputs: "undefined" 

51.temporal dead zone? 

The Temporal Dead Zone(TDZ) is a specific period or area of a block where a variable is inaccessible until it has been initialized with a value.
This behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with the let and const keywords, but not with var.
In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const variable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError.

function somemethod() {
  console.log(counter1); // undefined
  console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError
  var counter1 = 1;
  let counter2 = 2;
}

52.Scope ?

Scope is the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in some particular part of your code during runtime.
In other words, scope determines the visibility of variables and other resources in areas of your code.

53.variable without let const and var?

When you declare a variable without a keyword, it becomes a global variable. 
This means it's attached to the global object (window in browsers), potentially causing naming conflicts and making your code harder to manage.

54.types of promise?  

fulfilled - action is fulfilled
rejected - action failed
pending - action hasn’t succeeded or failed yet
settled - action is either fulfilled or rejected

55.for of and for in ?

for..in returns a list of keys on the object being iterated, whereas for..of returns a list of values of the numeric properties of the object being iterated.

56. Session and local storage ?

Session storage
Data is only available for the current session, which ends when the page is closed or the tab is closed. 
Each tab has its own separate session storage, so if the same site is opened in multiple tabs, each tab will have its own data. 

Local storage
Data persists across sessions and visits, and is only deleted when explicitly deleted or by the user. 
Local storage can have a storage capacity of 5–10 MB per domain

57.benefits of subject in angular ?

* muticasting * component communication * improved reactive programming 

Holding Values
If you subscribe to an subject, you won’t get the current value or initial value.
But when you subscribe to an Behavior Subject, you will be able to get the current value or the initial value.

 

Defining Values
You don’t have to define a default value whenever you declare the subject.
But you have to define a default value whenever you declare Behavior Subject based upon the data type.

 

Subscribers
In Subject, each next subscribers receive only the upcoming values.
In Behavior Subject, each next subscribers receive one previous value and upcoming values.

A Subject is like an Observable but can multicast to many observers which means subject is at the same time an Observable and an Observer.
A Subject is a Special type of Observable that allows value to be multicasted to many Observers. Subject are like event emitters.

58.gurads in angular ?

AuthGuard is an angular route guard used to protect the routes from unauthenticated/unauthorized people.

5 Different types of Route Guards are as follows:

CanActivate – Controls if a route can  be activated 
CanActivateChild – Controls if children of the route can be activated 
CanDeactivate – Controls if the user can leave the route
CanLoad – Controls if the route be loaded
